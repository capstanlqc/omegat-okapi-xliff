# OmegaT project packages

OmegaT projects can be packed and unpacked by means of the [OMT plugin](https://github.com/capstanlqc/plugin-omt-package), included in the [OmegaT customization](https://github.com/capstanlqc/omegat_customization).

This plugin adds three menu options to the **Project** menu:

-   Unpack project from OMT file
-   Pack project as OMT file
-   Pack and delete project

OMT packages allow for a standardized transfer of OmegaT packages.
